# mjl-pswdGenerator

This week's homework assignment was to use some preexisting code to create a web app that generates random passwords based on criteria set by the user in a series of prompts. It includes an event listener for the "Generate" button, it includes prompts for the password criteria, and it dyamically updates the page based the user's choices. Additionally, it is written to validate user input and to handle the possiblility that the user may cancel any of the prompts. 

Passwords are generated from any or all of a collection of character sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals (0-9), and special characters listed in [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

Although we were given the choice to use something other than prompts to gather user input (e.g., checkboxes), I chose to stick with the prompts because I wanted to see what this assignment as it was originally conceived had to offer.

Also note that, although I commented the .js file, I did not add comments to the index.html file or the .css file. It seemed appropriate to comment only the work I had done, which was all centered in the .js file.
